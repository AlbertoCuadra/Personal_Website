summary: Oral presentation in the 2025 Spanish Fluid Mechanics Conference
abstract: "The Combustion Toolbox (CT) is an open-source, MATLAB-based framework for chemical equilibrium computations and reactive flow analysis. Initially developed for combustion equilibrium calculations in gas- and condensed-phase systems, CT has evolved into a comprehensive package that supports a wide range of applications, including high-speed flow analysis, turbulence characterization, and planetary atmospheric models. Its intuitive graphical interface and object-oriented architecture make it a valuable resource for both research and education. The framework facilitates studies in high-temperature gas dynamics, propulsion systems, shock and detonation phenomena, and spectral turbulence analysis. Additional upcoming features, such as a novel shock-turbulence interaction module and a quasi-one-dimensional compressible flow solver, will further expand its versatility."

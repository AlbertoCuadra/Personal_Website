summary: Oral presentation in the 2025 Spanish Fluid Mechanics Conference
abstract: "This work presents an optimization algorithm for scramjet inlet geometry that incorporates thermochemical effects through the Combustion Toolbox, an in-house open-source thermochemical code. The solver uses a calorically imperfect gas model and employs a quasi-one-dimensional formulation to capture the variations of the flow properties along the isolator. The algorithm improves the preliminary design of scramjet engines by predicting the target temperature of the combustor inlet more accurately than calorically perfect gas models."

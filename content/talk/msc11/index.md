summary: Poster presented in the 11th Mediterranean Combustion Symposium.
abstract: "As a first step towards the development of a wider-scope thermochemical tool, in this work we present a thermochemical code with application to gaseous combustion   problems recently implemented by the authors in MATLAB. The code solves six chemical equilibrium problems (TP, HP, SP, TV, EV and SV transformations; where T denotes temperature, P pressure, H enthalpy, S entropy, E internal energy and V volume), incident and reflected planar shock waves, as well as ideal detonations according to Chapman-Jouguet theory, assuming always ideal gases in all cases."

abstract: The interaction between weak isotropic turbulence and a normal shock wave is investigated through linear
interaction analysis in a wide range of shock strengths, incluiding regimes at hypersonic March numbers. The strong-shock limit is revised by including the
effect of molecular dissociation of symmetric diatomic gases in chemical equilibrium, along with the corresponding translational, rotational
and vibrational contributions of the internal energy of the gas molecules. The resulting Rankine-Hugoniot curve is used to describe the interaction between the shock and a weak isotropic turbulent flow, the latter being characterized by a linear superposition of three-dimensional vortical disturbances. The formulation is developed in the limit that the thickness of the thermochemical non-equilibrium region downstream of the shock is much smaller than the characteristic
size of the ripples caused by the turbulence on the shock front. The analysis provide integral formulas for the kinetic energy amplification,
and for the disturbances of enstrophy, dissociation degree, and mean square of the density fluctuations. The results indicate that the endothermic effect of dissociation
significantly amplifies the intensity and anisotropy of the turbulence in the post-shock gas, where most
of the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the interaction is observed to belong to the velocity fluctuations along tangential directions to the mean motion of the shock.

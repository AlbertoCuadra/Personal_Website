We are in the final stage leading up to the official release of Combustion Toolbox v1.0.0. One of the tasks was to build a complete documentation on how to use it to supplement an upcoming publication for a scientific journal. Now, I'm pleased to announce that the Combustion Toolbox website is live! There's still a lot of information we want to include, but it's a great first step.

Best,

Alberto.

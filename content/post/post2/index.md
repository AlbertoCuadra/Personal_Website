The chemical equilibrium approach has been using extensively during the last century in order to find the chemical composition that would give a certain reaction.
This information can be very useful for many type of problems, e.g., .....
The resolution method is very easy for reactions that involve only a few number of species, but the complexity increases as the number of species increase as well, giving a problem that can be tought to resolve by hand.
In the late 1940's appeared the first themochemical code developed at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (nowadays, known as NASA) with the initial aim of evaluating rocket performance of various potential propellants.
With this precursor idea started the carrer on the development of themochemical codes. The most relevant open-source program is CANTERA. For students, CANTERA can be a steep path until you understand the basics.
In order to streamline the learning process. Currently, the code solves two chemical equilibrium problems (TP and HP transformations; where T denotes temperature, P pressure and H enthalpy), assuming always ideal gases in all cases.
The code computes the equilibrium composition by minimization of the Gibbsâ€“Helmholtz free energy, and employs NASAâ€™s 9-coefficient polynomial fits to evaluate the thermodynamic properties.

The chemical equilibrium approach has been using extensively during the last century in order to find the chemical composition that would give a certain reaction. This information can be very useful for many type of problems, e.g., ..... The resolution method is very easy for reactions that involve only a few number of species, but the complexity increases as the number of species increase as well, giving a problem that can be tought to resolve by hand. In the late 1940's appeared the first themochemical code developed at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (nowadays, known as NASA) with the initial aim of evaluating rocket performance of various potential propellants. With this precursor idea started the carrer on the development of themochemical codes. The most relevant open-source program is CANTERA. For students, CANTERA can be a steep path until you understand the basics. In order to streamline the learning process, we have developed another thermochemical code which also has a Graphic User Interface (GUI). Currently, the code solves six chemical equilibrium problems (TP, HP, SP, TV, EV and SV transformations; where T denotes temperature, P pressure, H enthalpy, S entropy, E internal energy and V volume), incident and reflected planar shock waves, as well as ideal detonations according to Chapman-Jouguet theory, assuming always ideal gases in all cases. The code computes the equilibrium composition using equilibrium constants rather than by minimization of the Gibbsâ€“Helmholtz free energy, and employs NASAâ€™s 9-coefficient polynomial fits to evaluate the thermodynamic properties.

**Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.

## Examples

### Code

Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the `highlight` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

### Charts

Academic supports the popular [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) chart format.

Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example `chart.json`, and then add the `{{</* chart data="chart" */>}}` shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.

Demo:

{{< chart data="line-chart" >}}

You might also find the [Plotly JSON Editor](http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/) useful.

### Math

Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file.

To render *inline* or *block* math, wrap your LaTeX math with `$...$` or `$$...$$`, respectively.

Example **math block**:

```latex
$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ 
\left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T 
\left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}
{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
```

renders as

$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$

Example **inline math** `$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$` renders as $\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$.

Example **multi-line math** using the `\\\\` math linebreak:

```latex
$$f(k;p_0^*) = \begin{cases} p_0^* & \text{if }k=1, \\\\
1-p_0^* & \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
```

renders as

$$f(k;p_0^*) = \begin{cases} p_0^* & \text{if }k=1, \\\\
1-p_0^* & \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$

### Diagrams

Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the `diagram` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.

An example **flowchart**:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
    A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result 1]
    C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
B --> C{Decision}
C -->|One| D[Result 1]
C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```

An example **sequence diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

An example **Gantt diagram**:

    ```mermaid

Parallel 3   :         des5, after des3, 1d
Parallel 4   :         des6, after des4, 1d
```

An example **class diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    classDiagram
    Class01 <|-- AveryLongClass : Cool
    <<interface>> Class01
    Class09 --> C2 : Where am i?
    Class09 --* C3

### Todo lists

You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:

```markdown
- [x] Write math example
- [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
```

renders as

- [x] Write math example
- [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else

### Tables

Represent your data in tables:

```markdown
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

renders as

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

### Callouts

Academic supports a [shortcode for callouts](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#alerts), also referred to as *asides*, *hints*, or *alerts*. By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* alert note */%}} ... {{%/* /alert */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* alert note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /alert */%}}
```

renders as

{{% alert note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /alert %}}

### Spoilers

Add a spoiler to a page to reveal text, such as an answer to a question, after a button is clicked.

```markdown
{{</* spoiler text="Click to view the spoiler" */>}}
You found me!
{{</* /spoiler */>}}
```

renders as

{{< spoiler text="Click to view the spoiler" >}} You found me! {{< /spoiler >}}

### Icons

Academic enables you to use a wide range of [icons from _Font Awesome_ and _Academicons_](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/#icons) in addition to [emojis](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#emojis).

Here are some examples using the `icon` shortcode to render icons:

```markdown
{{</* icon name="terminal" pack="fas" */>}} Terminal  
{{</* icon name="python" pack="fab" */>}} Python  
{{</* icon name="r-project" pack="fab" */>}} R
```

renders as

{{< icon name="terminal" pack="fas" >}} Terminal  
{{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}} Python  
{{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} R
